Report to the CEO
Assuming the role of CISO for your organisation, write a report to the CEO, drawing on your knowledge, and supported by the most recent academic publications and industry reports, to achieve executive support and funding for the launch of the New/Updated Security Policy you are proposing.

To establish the scenario, which you will base this assignment around:
 Firstly, select a country in which the head office of your organisation will be based.
 Secondly, detail and organisation which you will be the CISO of; consider aspects such as type (public sector, charity, education, financial, tech etc.) and scale (SME, National, Multinational etc) of the organisation.
 Finally decide on the Updates or new policies you are focussing on, you may select up to 3 policies.


Within the report you should in particular highlight the security culture you are aiming to achieve include:
1.the approach to the dissemination and monitoring,
2.the employee (user) support you are proposing.
3.the sanctions strategy you are advocating, and why.
All of the above must take account of both the country and company culture and security norms and maturity.
